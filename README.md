# GTFS_Data_Cleaning_and_Analysis
The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS), also known as GTFS static or static transit to differentiate it from the GTFS realtime extension, defines a common format for public transportation schedules and associated geographic information. GTFS "feeds" let public transit agencies publish their transit data and developers write applications that consume that data in an interoperable way.

The program cleans the data extensively using multiple methods and then perfroms complex analysis in order to derive valuable inference.
